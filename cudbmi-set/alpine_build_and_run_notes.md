## Image build

This section describes how to build the image which will be used to create the dataset.

### Requirements

The following resources are suggested for building the image (and not creating the dataset).

- __Resources__:
  - 32 GB of system memory
  - 1 GB of disk space

### Steps

1. Install Docker Desktop.

#### Image build and upload

1. Build images by running `sh ./cudbmi-set/build.images.sh`

   1. Build an Docker image `kg2:latest`: `docker image build -t kg2 ./Dockerfile`
   1. Build an extended Docker image which references the original kg2 image build (for decoupled additions from the upstream): `docker image build -t kg2-cudbmi-set ./cudbmi-set/Dockerfile.build-extended`
   1. Convert the related materials into Apptainer/Singularity images.

#### Testing within the container

1. Run and enter the container shell `singularity exec --writable-tmpfs -e --userns --cleanenv images/kg2-cudbmi-set.sif /bin/bash`

1. Run the script `/home/ubuntu/RTX-KG2/cudbmi-set/build.test.sh`

1. If all goes well, the setup script should end without an error.

1. Look in the log file `~/kg2-build/setup-kg2-build.log` to see if the script
   completed successfully; it should end with `======= script finished ======`.
   In that case it is safe to proceed.

1. Run a "dry-run" build: `bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh all -F -n`

1. inspect the file `~/kg2-build/build-kg2-snakemake-n.log` that will be created, to make sure that all of the KG2 build tasks are included. Currently, the file should end with the following count of tasks:

   ```
   Job counts:
           count   jobs
           1       ChEMBL
           1       ChEMBL_Conversion
           1       DGIdb
           1       DGIdb_Conversion
           1       DisGeNET
           1       DisGeNET_Conversion

           1       SMPDB_Conversion
           1       SemMedDB
           1       SemMedDB_Conversion
           1       Simplify
           1       Simplify_Stats
           1       Slim
           1       Stats
           1       TSV
           1       UMLS
           1       UniChem
           1       UniChem_Conversion
           1       UniProtKB
           1       UniProtKB_Conversion
           1       ValidationTests
           1       miRBase
           1       miRBase_Conversion
           48
   This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.

   ```

1. Upload Singularity image and/or Docker archive or image to Github repo. Optionally use Github packages as an image registry for reference by Singularity.

## Dataset creation

This section describes how to create the dataset by running a container based on the image built above.

- __Resources__:
  - 256 GiB of system memory
  - 1,023 GiB of disk space in the root file system
- __Data__:
  - pre-placed in related S3 buckets (referenced by `master-config.shinc` `s3_bucket`, `s3_bucket_public`, and
    `s3_bucket_versioned`):
    - full
      Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) distribution: `umls-2022AA-metathesaurus.zip` ([UMLS website](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/))
    - DrugBank distribution (`drugbank.xml.gz`)
- __Time duration__:
  - estimated to take 54-67 hours with Snakemake running on the built image
- __Data result__:
  - `kg2-simplified.json.gz`
  - Each build of KG2 is labeled with a unique build date/timestamp. The build timestamp can be found in the `build` slot of the `kg2-simplified.json` file and it can be found in the node with ID `RTX:KG2` in the Neo4j KG2 database.
  - Viewing progress: `tail -f ~/kg2-build/build-kg2-snakemake.log`
  - At the end of the build process, you should inspect the logfile `~/kg2-build/filter_kg_and_remap_predicates.log`

### Steps

Note: this assumes the section above, resulting in a Github Singularity image release is available.

#### Run container

1. Retrieve Apptainer/Singularity image from GitHub: `curl -LJO https://github.com/d33bs/RTX-KG2/releases/download/cudbmi-set-singularity-image/kg2-cudbmi-set.sif`

1. `singularity exec --writable-tmpfs -e --userns --cleanenv images/kg2-cudbmi-set.sif /bin/bash`

#### Prepare and validate container configuration

These steps are repeated from above as they only exist in the container and must be reproduced in each container runtime.

1. Run the script `/home/ubuntu/RTX-KG2/cudbmi-set/build.test.sh`

1. At some point, the script will finish and you're now ready to proceed.

1. Look in the log file `~/kg2-build/setup-kg2-build.log` to see if the script
   completed successfully; it should end with `======= script finished ======`.
   In that case it is safe to proceed.

#### Prepare data for RTX-KG2 builds

The following steps will help provide input data needed to accomplish the steps below.
If this data is not present, you may see errors when running the snakemake scripts below.
For example: `Missing input files for rule UMLS_Conversion: /home/ubuntu/kg2-build/umls.jsonl`.

1. Add the following data to your RTX-KG2 repository under this directory: `RTX-KG2/cudbmi-set/data-staging`
  - [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) [JSON lines](https://jsonlines.org/) data `umls.jsonl`

#### Data builds

Data builds may be performed in various test modes or as a "full / production" mode.
These are color coded by intensity for reader convenience (more red means more serious and time-involved).

- ðŸŸ¨ __Test build__: `sudo bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh alltest`
  - In the case of a test build, the a couple log file names are changed:
    - `~/kg2-build/build-kg2-snakemake-test.log`
    - `~/kg2-build/build-kg2-ont-test-stderr.log`
    - and all of the intermediate JSON and TSV files that the build system creates will have `-test` appended to the filename before the usual filename suffix (`.json`).

- ðŸŸ§ __(Post Test Build) Partial Test Build__: `bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh test`
  - This option is frequently used in testing/development. Note, you have to have previously run an `alltest` build, or else a `test` build will not work.
- Viewing progress: `tail -f ~/kg2-build/build-kg2-snakemake.log`

- ðŸŸ¥ __Full/"production" build__: `sudo bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh all -F`

1. Data log validation:

   - At the end of the build process, you should inspect the logfile `~/kg2-build/filter_kg_and_remap_predicates.log`

## Dataset transfer

This section describes how to transfer the data created by from the dataset creation steps above.

## Transcribed original directions

Original mostly unmodified directions as step-by-step for reference with usecases and troubleshooting on the above.

1. Install Docker Desktop.

1. Build a Docker image `kg2:latest`: `sudo docker image build -t kg2 ./Dockerfile`

1. Create a container called `kg2` from the `kg2:latest` image: `sudo docker create --name kg2 kg2:latest`

1. Start the `kg2` container: `sudo docker start kg2`

1. Open a bash shell as user `root` inside the container: `sudo docker exec -it kg2 /bin/bash`

1. Become user `ubuntu`: `su - ubuntu`

1. Install the `git` and `screen` packages if they are not already installed (though
   in an Ubuntu 18.04 instance created using the standard AWS AMI, they should already
   be installed): `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y screen git`

1. change to the home directory for user `ubuntu`: `cd`

1. Clone the RTX software from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/CU-DBMI/RTX-KG2.git`

1. Setup the KG2 build system: `bash -x RTX-KG2/setup-kg2-build.sh`

1. At some point, the script will print `fatal error: Unable to locate credentials`

1. The script will then prompt you to enter:

   - your AWS Access Key ID
   - your AWS Secret Access Key
     - (both for an AWS account with access to the private S3 bucket that is configured in `master-config.shinc`)
   - your default AWS region, which in our case is normally `us-west-2`
     - (you should enter the AWS region that hosts the private S3 bucket that you intend to use with the KG2 build system)
   - When prompted `Default output format [None]`, just hit enter/return.

1. If all goes well, the setup script should end with the message: `upload: ../setup-kg2-build.log to s3://rtx-kg2-versioned/setup-kg2-build.log`

1. Look in the log file `~/kg2-build/setup-kg2-build.log` to see if the script
   completed successfully; it should end with `======= script finished ======`.
   In that case it is safe to proceed.

1. Run a "dry-run" build: `bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh all -F -n`

1. inspect the file `~/kg2-build/build-kg2-snakemake-n.log` that will be created, to make sure that all of the KG2 build tasks are included. Currently, the file should end with the following count of tasks:

   ```
   Job counts:
           count   jobs

1. Data builds:

   - THIS STEP COMMENCES THE BUILD. Within the screen session, run: `bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh all -F`
   - Test build: `bash -x ~/kg2-code/build-kg2-snakemake.sh alltest`
     - In the case of a test build, the a couple log file names are changed:
       - `~/kg2-build/build-kg2-snakemake-test.log`
       - `~/kg2-build/build-kg2-ont-test-stderr.log`
       - and all of the intermediate JSON and TSV files that the build system creates will have `-test` appended to the filename before the usual filename suffix (`.json`).
